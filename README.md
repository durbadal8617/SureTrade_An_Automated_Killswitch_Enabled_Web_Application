# SureTrade_An_Automated_Killswitch_Enabled_Web_Application
SureTrade is a MERN-based stock trading platform with secure accounts, real-time portfolio tracking, and an automated risk kill switch. It features a responsive React UI, MongoDB-backed data management, and an LLM-powered chatbot for stock insights, financials, and market queries.

## Features
-  User Authentication – Secure signup/login and user profile management  
-  Real-Time Portfolio Tracking – Track holdings, funds, and watchlists

-  Responsive React Frontend – Clean UI with advanced stock search & support features  
-  LLM-Powered Chatbot – Provides stock fundamentals, company financials, and market insights  

Note: The user interface of SureTrade is designed with inspiration from Zerodha’s trading platform, offering a clean, minimal, and intuitive experience for users to seamlessly manage portfolios, track markets, and execute trades.
